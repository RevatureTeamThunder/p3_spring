# Quirky Pet Shoppe


Quirky Pet Shoppe is a business that sells pet supplies at affordable prices. Customers are able to purchase multiple of the same item at one time for convenience. Once an item is in the customer's cart, they can change the quantity of the item or remove the item from the cart. Customers are also able to leave reviews for products they have purchased to pass on their experience.

Products are able to be searched and the results can be sorted by name, price, category, quantity available, and by the amount of reviews a product has. There is an additional filter so customers can choose to only have products that cost less than a certain amount be displayed.

Purchase history is maintained for each customer so they can see what items they have purchased before. There are validation checks on the server side for making sure the product exists and that the customer is valid.
